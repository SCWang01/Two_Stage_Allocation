# Readme

1. This notation is inherited from the original test cases, where *WPP* referred to wind power plants.

In the current case studies, only PV power plants (PVPs) are considered. To distinguish **large-scale PV units** from other PV units without modifying the original code structure and variable names, large PVPs are kept under the *WPP* notation. No modeling assumptions or formulations are changed; this is purely a **naming convention for scale differentiation**.

2. The optimization solution is stored in the Test_solution from 5 to 50


3. The detailed data setting and member setting are in the  "Large_Case_Optimization_Function/data_definition_large.m and Parameter.mat" the internal member settings are in the VPP_list of each "Main_{Member_Size}Member.m"
4. **Data availability**
   The released case studies are anonymized and representative, while preserving the original statistical and operational characteristics.  The original data before Monte_Carlo Scenarios Generation Techniques  are obtained from the Shenzhen demand response market. Due to confidentiality constraints involving multiple commercial VPPs, the raw data are not publicly disclosed. The data can be made available upon reasonable request ; please get in touch with the authors if needed.
