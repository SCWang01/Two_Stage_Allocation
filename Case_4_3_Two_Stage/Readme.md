# Readme

This notation is inherited from the original test cases, where *WPP* referred to wind power plants.

In the current case studies, only PV power plants (PVPs) are considered. To distinguish **large-scale PV units** from other PV units without modifying the original code structure and variable names, large PVPs are kept under the *WPP* notation.

No modeling assumptions or formulations are changed; this is purely a **naming convention for scale differentiation**.
